### SoFaygo - Never Apologize (Concept/Compilation)
![N:A Concept Cover](https://github.com/HeyItsMicro/SoFaygo-Never-Apologize/assets/40962301/4a95b14b-234a-4bd0-b642-5a6830773d5f)

The greatest album you will ever hear.

**Known issue: Spotify local files do not show the cover art due to it not supporting the m4a file format. I had not realized this format is exclusive to Apple Music. To work around this, I will have to create another version of the comp with mp3 files which would support Spotify as well as any other music player. This is a lot of work for me to undertake for a platform I don't use so no ETA.**

A few notes:
- If a song is missing it's probably because I didn't like it (which is rare).
- The release dates included in each release description might not match the actual release date on GitHub, especially for older versions. This is because those dates are when I originally updated the album in my own local files, so you can ignore those dates.
- The songs are ordered alphabetically since there are simply too many for me to structure like an actual album, but I think it still sounds good when played straight through!
- All songs are tagged with the year 2024 to keep it simple. If anyone wants to go through the work of researching the year each song was made and making a pull request I will gladly update that information.
- Finally, if you listened to this and enjoyed it or have any suggestions, let me know!
